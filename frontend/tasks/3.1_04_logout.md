### 🧪 Testing Requirements

- [ ] **Component Tests**
  - Logout button rendering and interaction
  - Confirmation dialog behavior
  - Loading states during logout
  - Accessibility compliance
  - Theme application

- [ ] **Integration Tests**
  - Complete logout flow end-to-end
  - Token removal verification
  - Navigation after logout
  - Authentication state reset
  - Error handling scenarios

- [ ] **Security Tests**
  - Verify complete token removal
  - Confirm no sensitive data remains
  - Test navigation prevention to auth-only screens
  - Verify session cleanup completeness

### 🎯 Acceptance Criteria

**Given** an authenticated user wants to logout  
**When** they tap the logout button  
**Then** a confirmation dialog appears asking to confirm logout

**Given** a user confirms logout in the confirmation dialog  
**When** they tap "Confirm" or "Logout"  
**Then** JWT token is removed from storage and user navigates to login screen

**Given** a user cancels logout in the confirmation dialog  
**When** they tap "Cancel" or dismiss the dialog  
**Then** logout is cancelled and user remains on current screen

**Given** a user completes logout successfully  
**When** they try to navigate back  
**Then** they cannot return to authenticated screens without logging in again

**Given** a user logs out and another user logs in  
**When** the new user accesses the app  
**Then** no previous user data is visible or accessible

**Given** logout fails due to network issues  
**When** the logout process encounters errors  
**Then** user is still logged out locally and redirected to login

**Given** a user logs out  
**When** they attempt to access protected routes directly  
**Then** they are redirected to login screen automatically

**Given** a user with screen reader enabled  
**When** they navigate to logout option  
**Then** logout button is properly announced with clear action description

### 🔄 Logout Flow States

- [ ] **Initial State**
  - User is authenticated and on any app screen
  - Logout option is visible and accessible
  - Authentication state shows user as logged in

- [ ] **Confirmation State**
  - Confirmation dialog is displayed
  - User can confirm or cancel logout
  - Original screen content is still visible but dimmed

- [ ] **Processing State**
  - Loading indicator shown
  - Logout button disabled during processing
  - Token removal and cleanup in progress

- [ ] **Success State**
  - User navigated to login screen
  - Authentication state reset
  - All user data cleared from app

- [ ] **Error State**
  - Local logout completed regardless of network errors
  - User informed of any non-critical errors
  - Navigation to login screen still occurs

### 📱 UI Placement Options

- [ ] **Profile/Settings Screen**
  - Primary logout button in user profile
  - Clear "Sign Out" or "Logout" label
  - Positioned at bottom of profile options

- [ ] **Navigation Menu**
  - Logout option in main navigation drawer/menu
  - Clearly separated from other navigation items
  - Consistent with app navigation patterns

- [ ] **Header/Toolbar**
  - Quick logout option in app header (optional)
  - Icon-based with tooltip/label
  - Secondary placement for quick access

### 🔐 Security Considerations

- [ ] **Complete Data Cleanup**
  - Remove all authentication tokens
  - Clear user profile data from state
  - Reset any cached personal information
  - Clear any biometric authentication data

- [ ] **Navigation Security**
  - Prevent back navigation to authenticated screens
  - Reset deep link handling for authenticated routes
  - Clear any stored navigation state that includes auth data

- [ ] **Network Security**
  - Optionally call logout endpoint to invalidate server session
  - Handle logout API failures gracefully
  - Ensure local logout succeeds even if network fails

## 🚀 Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Basic logout functionality (token removal, navigation)
2. **Phase 2**: Confirmation dialog and user experience
3. **Phase 3**: Authentication context integration
4. **Phase 4**: Error handling and edge cases
5. **Phase 5**: Security hardening and cleanup verification
6. **Phase 6**: Accessibility and testing enhancements

## 🔗 Related Screens

- **Login Screen** (01_login.md) - Navigation destination after logout
- **Profile/Settings Screen** - Primary location for logout option
- **Home Screen** - May include logout in navigation menu
- **All Authenticated Screens** - Should redirect to login after logout
